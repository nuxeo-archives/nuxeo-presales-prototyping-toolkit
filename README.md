Nuxeo Presales team are daily producing Prototypes for our future customer to help them to imagine what can easily be done with the Nuxeo Platform. But some features recurrently needed and missing into the Nuxeo Platform.

So, we try to capitalize into this toolkit for prototyping project these development. 

**These development are not recommended for Production platform** as Nuxeo will not support usage of these development. This is a moving project (no API maintenance, no depreciation process, etc...). If some developments can be useful for the Nuxeo Platform according Tech Lead team, we will move these develoments into the next version of Nuxeo Platform.

Feel free to use it or let's be inspired for your own code.
